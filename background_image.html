        First, let’s bust the myth that fishes have super short memories. A number of studies support the fact that fishes actually have great memories. In one such study, rainbow fishes exhibited the ability to recall specific routes a year after they had been introduced to them, even though they hadn’t been around them for the interim.

       Did you know that fishes learn from each other and important information can actually be passed down through generations? Basically, one family of fishes can have cultural traditions (certain behaviors, feeding techniques, preferred locations etc..) unique to their family that is passed along to the next generation and so on.

     Fishes communicate with one another through a variety of ways, depending on the species. Some use sound, movement, color, smell, and bioluminescence. Some even use electrical impulses! Fishes may seem different but they have rich experiences and lives and much of this is facilitated by how they communicate with others.
